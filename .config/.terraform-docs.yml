  # terraform-aws-iam-group-restricted-admin

  GitHub: [StratusGrid/terraform-aws-iam-group-restricted-admin](https://github.com/StratusGrid/terraform-aws-iam-group-restricted-admin)

  This module creates a group and associated policies/roles to be able to grant users a restricted admin policy (full admin minus deletion of logs, cloudtrail, etc.) in addition to user self service rights. 
  The default policy requires MFA access for console, but not role assumption (though the role can be switched into), and requires role assumption for cli (best way to do MFA in cli).

  This is meant to be used as a one and done solution for people with a single AWS account who want to have/enforce MFA access on their admins.

  ## Example usage of the module:
  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/example1.tfnot" }}
  ```

  ## Using different policies
  To use this as a template for a different set of permissions, change the inputs, readme, and policy document/description in iam-policy.tf
  
  <span style="color:red">NOTE:</span> The MFA restrictions come from the DENY on the user self service policy. If that is removed, you should make two of the restricted-admin (or your replacement) policies. Make one to be used in the role and not have the BOOL MFA conditions, and have another one for the direct group attachment and have the conditions.
